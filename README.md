# Relay GraphQL Server for Loopback (Apollo Server)

Combine the powers of [ApolloStack](http://www.apollostack.com/) GraphQL with the backend of Loopback to automatically generate GraphQL endpoints based on Loopback Schema.

![Loopback Graphql](./resources/loopback-graphql.png?raw=true "LoopBack Apollo Architecture") 

## Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is a work in progress. Until version 1.0 endpoint API may change.

## Queries üí•
- Relay Specification: `node` query to fetch single entity by ID
- `viewer` query to fetch all models for a viewer
- Filter support for `where` and `order` filters on queries
- Support for relations and querying related data
- Relay Connections support for listed data
- Relay Pagination (`first`, `last`, `before`, `after`)
- Remote methods integration

## Mutations üöÄ
- Nested and clean schema structure
- Maps all `post`, `put`, `patch` and `delete` methods to mutations
- Remote methods integration

## Subscriptions ‚ö°Ô∏è
- `create`, `update` and `remove` events of all shared models.

## Other Features üéâ

- [x] Array
- [x] Boolean
- [ ] Buffer
- [x] Date

- [x] HasMany
- [ ] HasManyThrough
- [x] HasAndBelongsToMany
- [ ] Polymorphic
- [x] EmbedsOne
- [x] EmbedsMany
- [x] ReferencesMany

### Misc

### Todo
- [ ] File uploads


## Usage üíª

```sh
npm install loopback-graphql-relay
```
Add the loopback-graphql-relay component to the `server/component-config.json`: 

```
"loopback-graphql-relay": {
    "path": "/graphql",
    "graphiqlPath": "/graphiql",
    "subscriptionServer": {
      "disable": false,
      "port": 5000,
      "options": {},
      "socketOptions": {}
    },
    "viewer": {
      "AccessTokenModel": "CustomAccessToken",
      "relation": "user",
      "UserModel": "Account"
    }
  }
```

Requests will be posted to `path` path. (Default: `/graphql`);

Graphiql is available on `graphiqlPath` path. (Default: `/graphiql`);

Apollo's Subscription Server can be customised by passing `subscriptionServer` configuration. More information can be found at [SubscriptionServer Docs](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws#subscriptionserver).

## Inspiration üôå
This repository originally started as a fork of the [loopback-graphql](https://github.com/Tallyb/loopback-graphql) project by [Tallyb](https://github.com/Tallyb). But due to considerable change in the way query end points are created, this repository is maitained as an independant project.
